Version 1 - Working Code

In order to run:

stack install

start 4 terminals

In each terminal change directory to the base "hade" directory

terminal 1: ./hade-client localhost 8001

terminal 2: ./hade-client localhost 8008

terminal 3: ./hade-server localhost 8004

terminal 4: ./test.sh

You should get a listing of the first 500 lines of maps/src01_csv/in_test_csv1.csv

More to come
